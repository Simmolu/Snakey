Snake Game in Java

This is a small beginner project I did after I finished my Introduction to Java class, as I figured making this game in Java couldn't be too hard so long as I found the right libraries to use. I ended up using the Turtle library which utlizies StdDraw for drawing to the screen. The game uses an event system which monitors the typical game movement keys WSAD to move the head of the snake around the screen. If the player touches either side of the screen or their own tail the game ends. There is high score saving capability as well which will add the current score to a text file if it is higher than the stored value.
